## 1. Executive Summary

As organizations continue to scale their cloud infrastructure, maintaining visibility and control over the expanding technology stack becomes increasingly challenging, especially when embracing the multi-cloud strategy. While Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have become standard practice for application dependencies, no equivalent standard exists for cloud infrastructure components. This paper introduces the Cloud Infrastructure Bill of Materials (Cloud IBoM) - a comprehensive framework for documenting, tracking, and managing cloud infrastructure components across multi-cloud environments.

## 2. The Challenge

Organizations face several critical challenges in managing modern cloud infrastructure:

- **Visibility Gap**: No standardized way to inventory and track cloud infrastructure components across different providers and services
- **Version Management**: Difficulty in tracking and managing versions of various infrastructure components, from runtime environments to managed services
- **Lifecycle Management**: Challenge in identifying end-of-life components and planning upgrades
- **Cross-Team Communication**: Lack of common language and format for discussing infrastructure components across DevOps, Platform, and Development teams
- **Audit and Compliance**: Increasing difficulty in maintaining accurate records for audit and compliance purposes
- **Risk Analysis**: Challenge in understanding the underlying change, resulting in a possibly new behavior and unable to asses impact

## 3. The Solution

Cloud IBoM provides a standardized framework for documenting and tracking cloud infrastructure components, including:

#### Cloud Asset Management
- Compute Resources (VMs, Functions, Containers)
- Managed Services (Databases, Caches, Message Queues)
- AI/ML Services and Models
- Network Components
- Storage Resources
- Infrastructure as Code Assets
